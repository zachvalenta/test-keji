> üìç batch to ETL, streaming to where?
* _batch_: more than one at a time üìç Kleppmann chapter 9
* requires fewer trips to data source
* higher memory consumption
> Since the data in parsed_messages is essentially the same as that in raw_log but in a different form, parsed_messages probably takes up about the same amount of memory again as raw_log. We‚Äôre therefore using at least 20MB of memory to process a 10MB file.
```ruby
raw_log = File.read("samplelog.txt")
parsed_messages = parse_raw_log(raw_log)
message_stats = calculate_stats(parsed_messages)
```
* _stream processing_: one at a time üìô Kleppmann ch. 10 üóÑ `system.md` Kafka
* libraries: https://github.com/robinhood/faust https://github.com/apache/flink
* sources: clickstream, IoT sensors, time series
* lower memory consumption
> Once the block has finished executing, the Ruby interpreter is able to garbage collect the data for both the raw line and processed message, since it can see that the program won‚Äôt reference them again. This means that the Ruby interpreter can reuse the piece of memory in which they were stored.
```ruby
stats = {}
File.open("samplelog.txt").each_line do |l|
  message = parse_raw_log_line(l)
  stats = add_message_to_stats(message, stats)
end

# API

üîç https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
üìô Masse api rulebook

pagination
* _paginate_: return subset of records
* helps user and server both
* req `api/widgets?page=42` res can return header `x-total-count=<num>` https://slack.engineering/evolving-api-pagination-at-slack-1c1f644f8e12 https://www.reverb-api.com/docs#section-pagination

rate limiting
* _rate limit_: increase cost of fetching resource
* why: defense against DDoS, general protection against overload
* how: increase latency, serve error code
* via web server https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23948720 https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/
* via app (bucketing, GCRA) https://brandur.org/rate-limiting https://dev.to/astagi/rate-limiting-using-python-and-redis-58gk
```ruby
def rate_limit?(bucket)
  if !bucket.exists?
    bucket.set_value(RATE_BURST)  # 5000
    bucket.set_ttl(RATE_PERIOD)   # hour
  end

  if bucket.value > 0

## approaches

üìö
* Kleppmann ch. 3
* Masse api rulebook

REST
* _REST_: architectural style, not protocol [Kleppmann 4.133] nowadays means JSON over HTTP i.e. there are few to-the-letter RESTful APIs https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15939552 backend supports n clients (web, mobile) https://wsvincent.com/rest-a-definition/ https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZYRC8IbCwk
* definition https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32141027
* _Fielding paper_: not specific to HTTP; guided tour; no reference implementation http://mickadoo.github.io/rest/2016/09/26/what-is-rest.html https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means https://stackoverflow.com/a/983458/6813490 https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24384048
* _HATEOAS_: navigate API via links btw endpoints https://htmx.org/docs/#introduction https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2239405/hateoas-absolute-or-relative-urls https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139095/actual-examples-for-hateoas-rest-architecture https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/rest-hypermedia-hateoas/ https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/
> RESTful API design consequently suffers the same problems as Active Record ORMs. The problem is most severe when fundamentalist RESTafarians get involved, as they advocate using hypertext-style links between API endpoints - HATEOAS ("Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State"). Under HATEOAS, applications "browse" the API, moving from link to link to accomplish their goal. https://calpaterson.com/activerecord.html

JSON:API https://jsonapi.org
* req/res data fmt + more precise HTTP semantics https://changelog.com/podcast/189 46:30
* helps client not make unnecessary requests https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5654390
* the name is an annoying land grab https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5654375 
* other projects that aim for the same thing https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5653976
* ‚ùì diverges from OpenAPI https://phil.tech/api/2018/03/30/openapi-and-json-schema-divergence/
* _alternatives_: HAL https://jsonapi.org/faq/

SOAP
* tangled set of protocols

* API schema described using language called WSDL üìô Kleppmann [4.133]
* tighter coupling btw client/server http://keithba.net/simplicity-and-utility-or-why-soap-lost
* typically uses XML üìô Kleppmann [4.132]

RPC
* akin to intra-process communcation (more tightly coupled)
* apparently a bad idea üìô Kleppmann [4.134]
* only used inside your own data center üìô Kleppmann [4.136]
* argument for is no bikeshedding on HTTP semantics https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9597030
* https://etherealbits.com/2012/12/debunking-the-myths-of-rpc-rest/ https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/understanding-rest-and-rpc-for-http-apis/ https://apihandyman.io/do-you-really-know-why-you-prefer-rest-over-rpc/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15056878/rest-vs-json-rpc https://stackoverflow.com/a/26831221 https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl https://realpython.com/python-microservices-grpc/

GraphQL üìπ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJhiMSUFgDM
* spec + query language for API
* componenents: client (Apollo) server (Graphene)
* code generation https://hasura.io/
* _document_: request; what client sends to GraphQL server; can be sent over HTTP, sockets, SSH i.e. doesn‚Äôt depend on HTTP verbs
* operations: query (read) mutation (write)
* use case: avoid over-fetching, combine data from two services, better versioning üóÑ 'design'
* design https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32366759
* better metrics?
> In a REST API, an API provider must assume that for any given API resource, every field is in use by every user because they have no insight at all into which ones they‚Äôre actually using. https://brandur.org/graphql#explicitness
* _sink_: https://retool.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-graphql-ecosystem/ https://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-06-10-how-graphql-will-shape-the-alpha/ https://www.howtographql.com/ https://graphql.org/learn/ https://pganalyze.com/blog/efficient-graphql-queries-in-ruby-on-rails-and-postgres https://brandur.org/api-paradigms https://brandur.org/graphql https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23758367 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25432233 https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql 

representing individual resources in URL
* PK (bad) 
* UUID (unwieldy) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31715119
* short uuid (better https://0of1.com/blog/posts/django-staples/)
* _slug_: human readable addendum to URL resource id https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify
```sh
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/427102/what-is-a-slug-in-django
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/{id}/{slug}
```

misc
* just give folks everything and let them drill down vs. trying to predetermine what they need https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/ 38:00
* if API truly agnostic from frontend each page will end up making a bunch of calls instead of one call per page https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html
* standards at national level https://increment.com/apis/introduction-apis-egovernment/
* _streaming_: server pushes to client https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#streaming-requests
* _idempotent_: same req n times = no additional side effects after first req e.g. after initial req creates record, further requests won't create dupe https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency
* provide map of endpoints https://brandur.org/accessible-apis#programmatic-maps
* limit the number of req to get actionable info on resource https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/linode-object-storage-service-episode-125/ 25:00 JSON over REST and even higher level than that https://josephg.com/blog/api-for-changes/ https://josephg.com/blog/databases-have-failed-the-web/ https://josephg.com/blog/composing-databases/

## schema

* _schema_: typing üìô Kleppmann [4.122-128]
* _spec_: doc explaining schema https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lo7idI7uq8
* generate spec from API and vice versa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lo7idI7uq8 3:00

JSON Schema https://json-schema.org/
* validate incoming requests via decorator https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/json-api-openapi-and-json-schema-working-in-harmony https://stoplight.io/blog/openapi-json-schema/
```python
# decorator to validate req
def validate_request(schema: Dict[str, Any]) -> Callable:
    validator = fastjsonschema.compile(schema)
    def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
            data = await request.get_json()
            try:
                validator(data)
            except fastjsonschema.JsonSchemaException:
                abort(400)
            else:
                return await func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# add to endpoint
@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])
@validate_request(
    {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "due": {"type": "string", "format": "date"},
            "task": {"type": "string"},
        },
        "required": ["due", "task"],
        "additionalProperties": False,
    }
)
def endpoint():
    return res
```

OpenAPI
* _versions_: OpenAPI (v3) Swagger (v2)
* _schema_: description of API; formats differ between v2 and v3 https://docs.apistar.com/api-documentation/
* _parameters_: headers, query string, path https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/
* can generate schema from code https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14036628 https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg
* can generate code from schema https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14036871
* most people write schemas and code by hand https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14037238
* faster to just write your API and docs in Markdown https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14036469
* ‚ùì GraphQL makes this easier? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14037067

API Star https://github.com/zachvalenta/flask-openapi
> my current approach to documentation is "other developers, use my Makefile"
* build docs for OpenAPI service
* _history_: began as a project to bring DRF browsable dev docs to Flask https://github.com/flask-api/flask-api/commit/b99c8d26e335cef696b931dde783ca80ca4ab798 then became a framework https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/21/python-has-a-new-star-framework-for-restful-apis and now is a toolkit to add OpenAPI stuff to any framework
* `apistar validate`: lint schema
* `apistar request`: can't get this working
* `apistar.yml`: path to schema, whether Swagger or OpenAPI
* ‚ùì able to build static or have to run server?
* ‚ùì run alongside prod?
* ‚ùì no hot reload https://github.com/encode/apistar/issues/637 from when it was a framework? https://github.com/encode/apistar/issues/40 https://github.com/encode/apistar/pull/57

## versioning

> Also, as a general rule, you can at any given time get away with changing more than you think. Introducing change is like pulling off a bandage: the pain is a memory almost as soon as you feel it. - http://paulgraham.com/popular.html

* _versioning_: how to communicate changes to avoid breaking functionality for clients
> if you don‚Äôt define breaking and non-breaking, everything is potentially breaking...for example, we could add a new field to a JSON response and usually this wouldn‚Äôt lead to a problem, but somehow somewhere one client used the number of fields in a JSON object to get the right data. We could also decide to send too much data, and suddenly one client can‚Äôt keep up anymore. - https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Best-Practices-for-Versioning-REST-and-GraphQL-APIs/

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/designing-restful-web-apis/table-of-contents ‚ùì did the conery course go to his website
* https://increment.com/apis/web-api-versioning/

* _URL_: `/api/v2/bar` (downside: clients have to change)
* _query string_: `/api/bar?v=2` (upside: can have default version)
* _headers_: `X-Version: 2` or using the existing header `Accept: application/json; version=2`

* _impl agnostic_: decouple product release from API version (don't want new versions if no changes, silly to have hundreds of versions)
* _REST_: tell devs about change via new version
* _GraphQL_: tell devs about change via deprecating field -> seems like versioning by other means vs. not versioning at all (as the docs claim) https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/ https://blog.hitchhq.com/graphql-3-reasons-not-to-use-it-7715f60cb934

depends on use case
> Some applications where you would consider ditching Django to shave off some latency are: a stock trading marketplace; an global online advertisement serving network; a low level infrastructure control API - https://mattsegal.dev/is-django-too-slow.html
>  Forget that all these things exist: Microservices, Lambda, API Gateway, Containers, Kubernetes, Docker. Anything whose main value proposition is about ‚Äúability to scale‚Äù will likely trade off your "ability to be agile & survive". That‚Äôs rarely a good trade off. Start with a t3.nano EC2 instance, and do all your testing & staging on it. It only costs $3.80/mo. Then before you launch, use something bigger for prod, maybe an m5.large (2 vCPU & 8 GB mem). It‚Äôs $70/mo and can easily serve 1 million page views per day. - https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1154516910265884672

> We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time; premature optimization is the root of all evil. - Donald Knuth
* write code that's easy to throw away
> Write code to be changed and/or deleted. This comes from someone who's worked in startups for the past 5 years. We often overestimate how long code =is supposed to live. We as programmers often exaggerate with our DRY and stuff, we do not want to repeat ourselves, we want to find another abstraction...we want to find some general that can help us abstract stuff away. My piece of advice is that, step back and consider for a moment that this code is not going to stay in, so maybe only try and find the abstraction layer once you really sure that this is how it's going to be. - Thorsten Ball https://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-373-thorsten-ball-interpreters-compilers-and-writing
> To be attractive to hackers, a language must be good for writing the kinds of programs they want to write. And that means, perhaps surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs. - http://paulgraham.com/popular.html
* don't cargo cult 'best practices'
> Sophisticated design principles can make your code faster, more flexible, more modular, and all of the other positive adjectives that people use to describe high-quality software. But they also make it more complex. `AbstractSyntaxRenderers` and `DoubleBackflipDatabaseTransmogrophiers` do make some programs clearer and easier to understand, especially large ones. But they can also be the equivalent of using a metrics-oriented, fully agile, stakeholder-prioritized development flow for working on a jigsaw puzzle with your dad. Sure you‚Äôre following best practices, but you probably didn‚Äôt need to, and now your dad thinks you‚Äôre a Scientologist. - https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/02/programming-project-5-snake/
* wait for shared concerns to emerge -> repeat yourself until you find the right abstraction https://programmingisterrible.com/post/176657481103/repeat-yourself-do-more-than-one-thing-and
> There seemed to be a tendency to extract tiny packages first instead of waiting for a shared concern to emerge from the code and only then extracting a package. https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2017/12/31/writing-go/
> The problem with always using an abstraction is that you‚Äôre preemptively guessing which parts of the codebase need to change together. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself‚Äù will lead to a rigid, tightly coupled mess of code. Repeating yourself is the best way to discover which abstractions, if any, you actually need.

## caching

üìô Christian chapter 4
üóÑ
* proxy
* `http.md` caching

semantics
* _cache_: tmp storage for read; e.g. browser (SQLite) network (CDN) db (connection pool); can cache to either memory or disk https://danielmiessler.com/blog/nginx-caching-tempfs/
* _buffer_: tmp storage for write
* e.g. Python writerow
* _flush_: write buffer to disk https://stackoverflow.com/a/15042890
* _memoization_: cache at function level https://stackoverflow.com/a/6469470 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31434078
* _cold_: infrequently used data
* _hot_: frequently used data
* _cache hit_: can pull from cache
> A cache hit is hopefully much more than twice as fast as a cache miss. https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html
* _cache miss_: have to go to db
> It's important never to require a cache hit - even as a soft requirement. Evictions can happen at inconvenient times - such as when some other part of the system is under load - and there mustn't be any negative consequences to a cache miss. https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html

eviction, expiry
* _eviction_: rm item based on usage e.g. LRU
* _expiration_: rm item based on TTL https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html
> Data can be evicted before it has expired. And it often will be: most caches don't consider the TTL when looking for stuff to evict.
> Caching by TTL gives up correctness to gain speed.
* _LFU_: 
* random: 
* _LRU_: ensures cache full/hot as possible; used by application caches https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html
```python
# There's nothing wrong with the above code but it only allows for strategy #1: never invalidate https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html
from functools import lru_cache
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_slow_thing_v1(thing_id):
    thing = get_slow_thing_from_a_database_layer(thing_id)
    return thing
```
* _update-on-write_: update cache item on db write
> Sometimes you want to cache something that will change. For example, your application's User object: username, email address, postal address, etc. This data is bound to change over time but is also accessed extremely frequently, often on every request or as part of every operation. The best approach here is to update the cache whenever you update the data in your persistent store.

misc
* _cache stampede_: user req for item not in cache, code begins to generate, during generation other reqs for same item, code begins n generations, server falls over; avoid by putting flag in cache to say "hey, I'm working on creating this item"
* _thrashing_: when computation continuously interrupted by context switch of cache items from one program to another resulting in no computation being done
* _namespace_: add timestamp key (210526) to item key (user-bob) https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html

ideas https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html
> Using a cache often changes the implicit complexity class of the system - downwards, and towards constant time.
> There's a snobbery about application level caches. It's more respectable to rewrite the program in a "systems programming language" (read: fast, compiled, for the serious) than to apply Memcache liberally to your PHP app (read: a "band-aid", apache2, used only by jokers).
> One particularly naughty thing to do is to store web sessions only in the cache. A cache miss then becomes an involuntary logout for the hapless user who has done nothing wrong and transgressed no one. Instead, use strategy #2 above and store the web-sessions in your database, using your cache just as a speedup.
> One tip: it's best to start by looking to invalidate. To paraphrase someone: "ask not of what you can cache - ask of what you can invalidate". If you can't invalidate something reliably, it's unlikely that you can cache it in the first place.

in general

> A good example of a piece of functionality that is better handled with decoration is memoization or caching: you want to store the results of an expensive function in a table and use them directly instead of recomputing them when they have already been computed. This is clearly not part of the function logic. [Hitchhiker's Guide 3.1.6]

* _machine_: hw (or vm) https://sre.google/sre-book/production-environment/
* _server_: machine w/ server sw or sw itself https://sre.google/sre-book/production-environment/
* _web server_: deal w/ HTTP, handle static content and rate limiting https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-nginx-and-gunicorn
* port 80
* BYO https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/

* can also be pressed into service as combo app/web server https://stackoverflow.com/a/38982989 https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/application-server-vs-web-server/
* port 8080

connections
* _threads_: single (one thread per connection; WSGI, PHP) multi (üìç http://aosabook.org/en/nginx.html https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html#adding-concurrency-and-monitoring)
* _idle_: different languages require diff amount of memory e.g. Golang allocates buffer in preparation for data to be read (whereas C++ does not) https://blog.phusion.nl/2018/09/18/migrating-passenger-from-cxx-to-go/
* _multiple_: connections from many clients to single server
* _parallel_: multiple connections from single client to a server; HTTP spec recommends max of 2; workaround is multiple servers deal with different resources
* _persistent_: Keep-Alive, WebSocket
* _pipeline_: send a bunch of requests before waiting for response

types
* _proxy_: layer between requester and responder
* _reverse proxy_: closer to servers; less of a need given a cloud environment where a load balancer is already built-in https://pythonspeed.com/articles/gunicorn-in-docker/ https://testdriven.io/blog/django-docker-traefik/
* _forward proxy_: closer to users; way for users to access resources outside network https://www.linuxbabe.com/it-knowledge/differences-between-forward-proxy-and-reverse-proxy
* _sidecar proxy_: https://caddyserver.com/docs/

CDN
> Caching reverse proxies that you self-host, like Varnish and Apache Traffic Server, can use non-standard PUSH and PURGE verbs that let you explicitly control the cache contents. If you can invalidate explicitly you can use strategies #2 and #3 [update-on-write]. If you have the file on hand, why not also populate your reverse proxy's cache? The nice thing overall about caching at the HTTP level is that it takes work off the applications server's plate. https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html

* _design patterns_: ‚ùì inherently OOP? [Conery 236]
* _adapter_: wrapper e.g. ORM class for Postgres, MySQL, et al. [Conery 249]
* _bridge_: allows you to update abstraction w/breaking impl i.e. yet another layer of abstraction [Conery 250]
* _decorator_: wrapper [Conery 254]
* _facade_: wrapper [Conery 255]
* _flyweight_: storage for other obj to use, cuts down on memory usage [Conery 257]
* _abstract factory_: dedicated class to construct `CustomerFactory().default()` [Conery 243]
* _singleton_: class that only allows single instance of itself; naive impl can go haywire in multithreaded env [Conery 248]
* _mediator_: obj passing msg btw two other obj [Conery 261]
* _observer_: obj that listens to events from another obj
* _strategy_: pass algo at runtime i.e. `charge(normal_price)` or `charge(half_off)`

semantics
* _comment engine_: https://github.com/umputun/remark42 or just use a repo https://lists.sr.ht/~skeeto
* _devops_: align incentives of dev (functionality) and ops (stability); make sysadmin scale
* _files - static_: CSS, JS, fonts https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-static-files
* _files - media_: uploaded by user https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/files/#managing-files
* _mirroring_: http://www.postfix.org/mirror.html

money
* rightsizing https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2021/01/12/kubecost-with-webb-brown/
* on-prem: need to integrate w/ legacy systems inside firewall, regulatory, cheaper, you can still make the consumption of your data center feel like a public cloud (CF, HPE)

## deployment

üóÑ
* `security.md` secrets mgmt
* `sql.md` migrations

deployment
* _deployment_: align higher env w/ lower env https://css-tricks.com/deployment/
* _staged deployment_: deploy to a few nodes at a time üìô Kleppmann 4.112
* _blue-green deployment_: split traffic btw new and old; aka red-black

release
* _release_: users get latest deployment
* have a `RELEASE.md` https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26902887
* have a runbook https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process#inside-an-iteration
* _canary release_: only subset of users get latest deployment https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/automated-canary-analysis-at-netflix-with-kayenta-3260bc7acc69 

impl https://css-tricks.com/deployment/
* _yolo_: edit on server
* _FTP_: edit on local, push to server
* _SCM_: SSH to sever and pull repo, maybe use cron
* _CICD_: repo hook triggers CICD

feature flagging
* _feature flag_: toggle functionality; impl agnostic (env var, db, aaS) https://medium.com/@noahrobi/feature-toggles-give-you-superpowers-78fdeb7ab5e8
* use cases: decouple deployment/release, canary release https://github.com/facebook/planout A/B testing https://findwork.dev/blog/django-b-testing-google-optimize https://www.evanmiller.org/
* lib: https://waffle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
* service: paid (Launch Darkly, Split.io, Optimizely) on-prem (https://github.com/markphelps/flipt https://bullet-train.io/ https://github.com/Unleash/unleash)
* as tech debt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhxNaPYpYiU https://github.blog/2021-04-27-ship-code-faster-safer-feature-flags/
* feature-flag-driven development
> Always start a feature with a feature flag and try to get something to production on day 1. even if it's only feature flagged to you. usual feature flag timeline: week 1 - developer and people interested in a feature week 3 - release or do beta with users
```python
class FeatureFlag(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=80)
    enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

incidents
* _fault_: when something goes wrong [Kleppmann 7]
