* _layer 1_: electrical engineering, wires, frequencies 
* _data link_: physical medium for transmission of signal btw nodes [NKH 30]
* _materials_: radiowaves over air, light over glass (fiberoptic; lowest signal loss) electricity over copper (Ethernet; degrades over even short distances; DSL is copper wires from ISP) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUo45NqPyq8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaGXPObx2Gs

assets
* _asset_: generic term for infra (plant, az, cluster, etc.)
* _server_: vm in cluster
* _cluster_: n vms in pod
* _pod_: hw rack
* _az_: grouping in plant
* _plant_: all az

metrics
* usage
* peak
* p90

misc
* hierarchy: server, cluster, pod, plant
* data center vendors: Equinix, CoreSite, and Digital Realty Trust
* _UCS_: Cisco data center server mgmt e.g. you have UCS to manage a bunch of UCS (Cisco) servers
* _Pure Storage_: flash for UCS server
* _Netflow_: Cisco protocol to export traffic data from their devices [Network Flow Analysis] there's also something called 'sflow'
* _Redfish_: API to manage DMTF servers
* _DMTF_: consortium (Dell, Lenovo)

## hardware

* _repeater_: take in signal, interprets data, generates new clean signal, outputs signal; fights attentuation (degradation of signal over distance); half-duplex
* _hub_: same as repeater but outputs to multiple ports aka 'multiple port repeater'; allowed transition from hub topology to star
* _switch_: handle data inside your network; connects devices; uses MAC addr to map to node which listens on specific port which, combined with buffers to store data, allows for full duplex; the amount of traffic today demands full duplex
* _router_: connect networks e.g. LAN to WAN [Cisco Routers for the Desperate 2.11]
* _default gateway_: IP address of router
* _modem_: connect to ISP's WAN (via coax cable) üóÑ `netgear-modem.zip`

companies offering "track this cell phone anywhere on the planet" aaS

> The underlying issue with SS7, however, is that the network believes whatever you tell it: anyone with access to the SS7 network can send a message, and the network may not check where the message is coming from, or whether a legitimate telecoms company sent it. - https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-companies-that-will-track-any-phone-on-the-planet

> SS7, invented in 1975, is still the protocol that allows telephone networks all over the world to talk to one another. It was built on the assumption that anyone who can connect to the network is a trusted network operator. When it was created, there were only 10 companies using SS7. - https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/cellphones-security-spying.html

> Another protocol, GSM, invented in 1991, allows your cellphone to communicate with a cell tower to make and receive calls and transmit data. The older generation of GSM, known as 2G, doesn‚Äôt verify that the tower that your phone connects to is authentic, making it easy for anyone to use a cell-site simulator and impersonate a cell tower to obtain your location or eavesdrop on your communications...later generations of GSM such as 3G, 4G and 5G solve many of its problems. Yet our phones all still support 2G and most have no way to disable it, making them susceptible to attacks. What‚Äôs more, research has shown that 3G, 4G, and even 5G have vulnerabilities that may allow new generations of cell-site simulators to continue working. - https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/cellphones-security-spying.html

While network operators would usually prefer to send data through their own networks, often a more direct and cost-efficient path is provided by other providers‚Äô infrastructure. If one network in a specific area of the country is overloaded with data traffic, another operator with capacity to spare can sell or exchange bandwidth, reducing the strain on the congested region. This exchange of traffic is called ‚Äúpeering‚Äù and is an essential feature of the internet.

The data exchange between AT&T and other networks initially takes place outside AT&T‚Äôs control, sources said, at third-party data centers that are owned and operated by companies such as California‚Äôs Equinix.

As of March 2018, some 197 petabytes of data ‚Äì the equivalent of more than 49 trillion pages of text, or 60 billion average-sized mp3 files ‚Äì traveled across its networks every business day.

Under a Ronald Reagan-era presidential directive ‚Äì Executive Order 12333 ‚Äì the NSA has what it calls ‚Äútransit authority,‚Äù which it says enables it to eavesdrop on ‚Äúcommunications which originate and terminate in foreign countries, but traverse U.S. territory.‚Äù That could include, for example, an email sent by a person in France to a person in Mexico, which on its way to its destination was routed through a server in California. According to the NSA‚Äôs documents, it was using AT&T‚Äôs networks as of March 2013 to gather some 60 million foreign-to-foreign emails every day, 1.8 billion per month.

Without an individualized court order, it is illegal for the NSA to spy on communications that are wholly domestic, such as emails sent back and forth between two Americans living in Texas. However, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the agency began eavesdropping on Americans‚Äô international calls and emails that were passing between the U.S. and other countries. That practice was exposed by the New York Times in 2005 and triggered what became known as the ‚Äúwarrantless wiretapping‚Äù scandal.

In 2008, Congress weighed into the dispute and controversially authorized elements of the warrantless wiretapping program by enacting Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act, or FISA.

 A classified 2012 memo describes the agency‚Äôs efforts to use IP addresses to home in on internet data passing between the U.S. and particular ‚Äúregions of interest,‚Äù including Iran, Afghanistan, Israel, Nigeria, Pakistan, Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. But this process is not an exact science, as people can use privacy or anonymity tools to change or spoof their IP addresses. A person in Israel could use privacy software to masquerade as if they were accessing the internet in the U.S. Likewise, an internet user in the U.S. could make it appear as if they were online in Israel. It is unclear how effective the NSA‚Äôs systems are at detecting such anomalies.

A top-secret NSA memo about the court‚Äôs ruling, which has not been disclosed before, explained that the agency was collecting people‚Äôs messages en masse if a single one were found to contain a ‚Äúselector‚Äù ‚Äì like an email address or phone number ‚Äì that featured on a target list.

‚ÄúOne example of this is when a user of a webmail service accesses her inbox; if the inbox contains one email message that contains an NSA tasked selector, NSA will acquire a copy of the entire inbox, not just the individual email message that contains the tasked selector,‚Äù the memo stated.

Today, the facility contains six large V-16 yellow Caterpillar generators that can provide backup electricity in the event of a power failure, according to the Chicago Sun Times. Inside the skyscraper, AT&T stores some 200,000 gallons of diesel fuel, enough to run the generators for 40 days.

Saunders also claimed that, had Bush been in Manhattan during the 9/11 attacks, the Secret Service would have taken him to safety inside the AT&T facility. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the strongest building in town,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBy cutting into the peering links, they get not only AT&T‚Äôs data, they get all the data that‚Äôs interchanged between AT&T‚Äôs network and other companies,‚Äù Klein told The Intercept in a recent interview.

In 2011, CenturyLink acquired Qwest as part of a $12.2 billion merger deal.
