strengths and weaknesses

> half the time this business comes down to "I don't like that guy." https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29082060
> Code isn’t just obscure commands in a file. It requires you to have a map in your head, to know where the good libraries, the best documentation, and the most helpful message boards are located. If you don’t know where those things are, you will spend all of your time searching, instead of building cool new things. - Ford what is code?
* _bad at_: no degree = never written a compiler

* _technical problem solved_: TR server
* _5 years from now_: staff engineer
* _conflict_: no (I've had multiple managers comment that I my teammates seemed to really like me and I was good at faciliating) yes (manager who was logging db credentials, running unsanitized queries, code had to be updated per env)
* _mistakes_: no (never accidentally dropped tables or taken down services) yes (scoping stories, which is why I'm now determined to have the smallest possible tickets)
* _staying up to date_: devs (newsletter for Python, Django, Golang, podcasts) https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar 🗄 keeping up
* _good leader_: point guard https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20236685
> I've spent a lot of time asking about why things are the way they are, both in areas where things are working well, and in areas where things are going badly. Where things are going badly, everyone has ideas. But where things are going well...almost no one has any idea why things work. It's magic. If you ask, people will literally tell you that it seems really similar to some other place they've worked, except that things are magically good instead of being terrible for reasons they don't understand. https://danluu.com/wat/

> For whatever reason, this big picture knowledge about how to bring everything together to make effective software is rarely taught explicitly. Rather we mostly see guides to the latest syntax or features of the framework du jour. Having been in this game for over a decade, I know full well this sort of surface knowledge has the shortest shelf-life. If you've got more of a taste for the slower-changing, thoroughly unsexy principles behind writing stable and maintainable software, I'm devoting myself to exploring these ideas with my screencasts - topics like data integrity, building instrumentation for knowing what's happening in your code (esp. in production), non-brittle tests, leaning on unix tools and the OS to debug things, the timeless editor vim, etc. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23702061

simplify https://codecrafters.io/challenges

* interfaces https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/ Scrimba

names
* _boring software labs_: more striking, more obviously negative and therefore foregrounds irony, easier to pitch "do this long-term useful thing and reap the rewards"
* _rough cut code_: complete, coherent, workable, still work to do

marketing
* _distribution_: site, Youtube
* _marketing_: HN, newsletters
* _payment model_: McKenzie; subscription is a treadmill for user and operator
* where to exist: site, email
* why no books, no Twitter: time cost of babysitting each account

* _worst case_: spend a year getting better at fundamental comp sci and put myself on a more lucrative career path while having social cover (starting a business), overlap with music (site design, infra, business, more flow)
> why leave current contract? attention; you've had two stretches in 2019 (London, summer) of free time but had distractions (financial stress, job hunting) and worse habits / lesser pursuits

things that could make it fail
* there's already something in this exact niche
* it will take me much longer to learn the material I need to teach

product form factors
* _test prep_: the interview mill
* _random walk_: publishers (15 books on NLP, 0 on HTTP) PS, zines (encapsulated well, however)
* _academic_: Dan Luu recommendations
* _reference_: sql book
* _magisterial_: LPI, Skiena

> like zines but actionable
* show! deliverable, first/last LOC
* _deliverable_: a core idea, afternoon-sized, work you can show
* get better at things that tend to matter more for senior devs
* own whatever you pay for; each short consists of plain text and code
* avoid 1 your current job determining your next job 2 jumping on the interview-prep Hacker Rank treadmill
* don't want to learn ER design from reading about it, want to _do_ it
* a lot of things that senior engineers get to do (ER design, system design) are catch-22
* demonstrate knowledge: vs. activity (GH) algos (don't do at work) all the stuff in your head (doesn't always come through in interviews)
* durable topics
* 1-5 years experience (you have enough experience if know how to use a terminal, you have too much if you wrote the terminal)
* long-term: my disposition is to work for myself - smaller companies are better but I want to make the decisions, don't think it's a big/small company thing - need to settle for corporate job for retirement savings by age 40, can use starting company as execuse to be out of the workforce and spending a lot of time on music
* TDD! even the Ball book has a very long feedback loop, even more so for Vincent; check out Herman here; also, UX is a big part, Herman tutorials don't really give you the sense of progress bc there are no sections; the reader needs to feel a constant sense of incremental progress; mark sections with hashs so they can be referenced in notes the way that your system does; how to show all sections (drop-down, sidebar? how does Gitbooks do this?)
* why not write shorter things like Evans and have visuals and charge less?
* don't explain why people should pay vs. reading blog post; design, writing should convey that
* individual tie but different entity https://wizardzines.com/
* aspirational stuff sells better (compilers, databases)? 
* people unwilling to pay for boring, open-ended stuff?
* why should I do it? PG, I like it and other people think to seem it's hard
* _kernel_: DAS but smaller units and different payment model
* _my secret_: people will pay for products, whether that's whimsy (Evans) or defined output (me, Itamar, DAS); people will pay for courese (Janetakis) and books (Ball) but the margins are lower and the demands higher for the author, so keep your output and scope defined (me)
* _inspiration_: Janetakis, McKenzie, Ball, Evans, Vimcasts, Destroy All Software, Vincent, Herman, Vim Valley, Interview Cake, https://www.semicolonandsons.com
* spirit: LWN
* have an index
* have album covers https://wizardzines.com/ Behance

* use images/illustrations to chunk https://twobithistory.org/2018/06/10/birth-of-the-web.html

* why? learn and get paid (something but way less than full-time engineering job) for it, if you string together multiple tutorials on a topic you might be able to get a book deal from Manning
* _timeline_: build in a year, turn on, go back to job and meanwhile site starts to make money
* _building for maintenance_: boring and stable tech (e.g. Python LTS), plain text so that it's easy for me (for plain text, need a way to show the current working state in a way that resembles Twitch-style coding)

> Blunt talk is seen as a good quality in a developer, a sign of an "engineering mindset"—spit out every opinion as quickly as possible, the sooner to reach a technical consensus. Expect to be told you’re wrong; expect to tell other people they’re wrong. (Masculine anger, bluntly expressed, is part of the industry.) - Ford what is code

> My recipe application is going to be written in a purely functional language with CQRS and a message bus that provides "guaranteed once" determinism. I should be able to spin up no more than a half dozen containers on two VM's to handle this architecture. The database will probably be redundant MSSQL and Oracle (just in case one technology is fundamentally broken). Database writes will be proxied by a Redis instance. I will use 3x 3080 GPU to train a ML model used for scaling the recipe depending on the number of people you wish to serve. Hmmm...I might need a third VM. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29729411

> The problem I keep seeing in startups is that a lot of startup tech founders and employees don't see a startup as an embryonic business that will grow over the long term into a money-making venture requiring calculated risks and priorities, but rather as a personal playground to do all the fun things they were not allowed to do at their old BigCorp. Use cool framework or language X? Use Kubernetes? Microservices? Lambdas? No-SQL? Two fingers to BigCorp, I'm CTO/tech employee #1 at a new startup and I get to do whatever I want. If and when it goes down in flames, I now have these skills on my resume I can leverage into a better opportunity. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31798063

## open source (FOSS)

> This is depressing for project creators. Early on, they have the triumphant experience of building exactly what they want, and solving their nagging problem. And the result is that they’re cleaning up after a bunch of requests from people who are either annoyed that it doesn’t work for them or have unsolicited feedback on how it ought to work. No wonder Linus Torvalds gets so mad. Running a successful open source project is just Good Will Hunting in reverse, where you start out as a respected genius and end up being a janitor who gets into fights. https://diff.substack.com/p/working-in-public-and-the-economics

## standards bodies

* how RFCs work https://stackoverflow.com/a/1961018
> There are standards track documents and non-standard track (informational) documents. The entire process, including descriptions, processes and rules for IETF issued documents is defined by RFC2026 with some follow on amendments. Every RFC will specify at the beginning which track it is on. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2026
> RFC is an acronym that stands for "Request For Comments," meaning it is intended on gathering feedback from the community. That being said, almost the entire internet runs on unratified RFCs, or less. The CSV "standard" itself is essentially undefined without RFC4180. It is the most definitive model we have although it might change someday. As it stands, RFC4180 has no provisions for inserting comments. If you add your own commenting mechanism to the format, don't expect interoperability with other reader/writers that follow RFC4180. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180
