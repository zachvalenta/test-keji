## done

* _21_: prepopulate commit msg
* _20_: stash commands, üìô Chacon ch 1-2, Gitlab as secondary remote for notes, auth for BNY (Gitlab token types, server protocols and set up, lots of debugging)
* _19_: hooks (pre-commit) branches (another pass at merge squash rebase) tooling (GitUp, Tig)
* _18_: PR workflow
* _17_: desultory corporate usage, tutorial w/ Roberto

# PLUMBING

üôÇ punk rock https://xkcd.com/1597/

* _snapshot_: files at particular time e.g. a commit https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository
* `checkout`: will move rm changes to file in working tree e.g. if file is updated and staged, then updated again, checkout will only rm most recently updates i.e. changes in staging area won't be affected
* _reference_: human-readable name acting as point to commit SHA-1

## states

file state https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository
* _untracked_: anything that wasn't in the last snapshot and not currently in the staging area i.e. files that Git doesn't know about
* _unmodified_: not updated since last commit
* _modified_: updated since last commit
* _staged_: to be incl in next commit, after which it will return to unmodified

sections https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F
* _working directory_: modified; aka 'working tree'; 'clean' = empty = no modified files
* _index/staging area_: staged; file changes marked for save in next commit
* _repository_: committed; `.git`

## design history

VCS history https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
* _version control_: stores content and tracks changes to content https://medium.com/@willhayjr/the-architecture-and-history-of-git-a-distributed-version-control-system-62b17dd37742
* _first generation_: SCCS
* _second generation_: 2000 - centralized - CVS, SVN/Subversion, Perforce, Bitkeeper https://twobithistory.org/2018/07/07/cvs.html
* _third generation_: 2005 - distributed - Git (dominance such Stack Overflow dev survery no longer asks about VCS and people even use as a client to other VCS https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Git-as-a-Client) alternatives (FB uses Mercurial http://aosabook.org/en/mercurial.html SQLite uses Fossil)
* Git for everything https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30522175

Git
* _distributed_: less network latency than centralized https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control full version of repo history https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
* _reversible_: Git database onlys adds data so it's hard to do something that's not reversible https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F
* _no server_: no predefined client/server relationship among repos i.e. Github acts as a server but could be just another client https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/05/14/beyond-punk-rock-git-in-eleven-steps/
* _doesn't handle large repos or large file sizes_: meant for text https://superuser.com/q/13376 hence VFS (virtual fs) for Git https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/53/getting-started-with-devpi-and-git-virtual-fs https://medium.com/@mattklein123/monorepos-please-dont-e9a279be011b https://medium.com/@adamhjk/monorepo-please-do-3657e08a4b70 https://medium.com/opendoor-labs/our-python-monorepo-d34028f2b6fa https://css-tricks.com/from-a-single-repo-to-multi-repos-to-monorepo-to-multi-monorepo/ git lfs https://stackoverflow.com/a/38313259 can now handle binary? https://tech.marksblogg.com/git-track-changes-in-media-office-documents.html

## merge

semantics
* _merge_: interleave n commits üìô Chacon 144
* _cherry pick_: put 1 commit onto tip of branch https://stackoverflow.com/a/9339460
* can always just merge other branch if it's only one commit ahead of master
* _rebase_: put n commits onto tip of branch https://stackoverflow.com/a/43551395
* can also use `squash` https://stackoverflow.com/q/2427238
* my notes workflow: `git rebase -i main`
```sh
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/5340773

# main
git init
echo "hi" > ex.txt
ga
gc  # init

# feature
git nb feature
echo "hey" > feat.txt
ga
gc  # on feature

# master
echo "hola" > ex.txt
ga
gc   # on main

# before rebase
* 353382c (main) on main
| * dd8a610 (HEAD -> feature) on feature
|/
* 44496c2 init

# rebase
git rebase main

# after rebase
* 99f30ad (HEAD -> feature) on feature
* 353382c (main) on main
* 44496c2 init
```


scenarios
* squash commits on feature: `rebase -i main` (pick first commit)
* changes from master onto feature: `rebase main` https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/avoid-80-of-merge-conflicts-with-git-rebase-b5d755a082a6
> this calls into question the above definition of rebase insofar as commits from master go onto tip of feature *and then feature commits go after that*

---

scenarios
* fetch: 
* pull: 
* pull --rebase https://goiabada.blog/git-tricks-avoiding-merge-when-dealing-with-remote-conflicts-52c175e526e6 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2472254/when-should-i-use-git-pull-rebase https://gitolite.com/git-pull--rebase

* use case is maintaining linear history https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase apparently the use case for why you'd want to rebase instead of merge becomes more clear if you understand directed acyclic graphs https://stackoverflow.com/a/9147389/6813490 use rebase to split up a commit https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/git/split-up-a-commit.md rebase faster https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/git/squashing-commits.md
* _grab file from another branch_: https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/git/grab-a-file-from-another-branch.md

__how to__

* _squash feature already on remote_: `rebase -i develop; push --f` https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git
* _put feature on master as single commit_: `rebase -i master; checkout master; merge <feature>` (irl open PR) https://stackoverflow.com/a/3697230/6813490 

* _rebase_: feature branch onto master as single commit  (everything in one commmit, but probably skip merging directly into master in favor of PR) `merge --squash my_feature` (still includes commit history) https://stackoverflow.com/a/3697263/6813490 more complex use case https://stefanoborini.com/beautiful-git-rebasing-of-version-branch/
* _squash_: everything on branch `git rebase --root -i` https://stackoverflow.com/a/9254257/6813490 could just blow away `.git` but would lose all other branches https://stackoverflow.com/a/1657287/6813490
```sh
$ echo "hey" > foo.txt  # 'first'
$ echo "hi" > foo.txt  # 'second'
$ echo "hello" > foo.txt  # 'third'

pick 80658a7 first  # have to squash newer commits into older ones i.e. pick the oldest commit and squash everything else https://stackoverflow.com/a/51516360/6813490

* user setup: add public key

* _bare repository_: only git data (`.git`) with no working directory i.e. no actual files https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols
* _GitWeb_: built-in GUI for server https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-GitWeb

## auth

* store credentials using macos Keychain https://gist.github.com/nepsilon/0fd0c779f76d7172f12477ba9d71bb66

protocols for data transfer https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration
* _local_: use own machine (or NFS mount) as remote
* _http_: smart version uses auth and allows writes, dumb version read-only and no auth; can cache user/pass using macos Keychain
* _ssh_: non-anonymous, need to futz with keys
* _Git_: daemon that comes packaged with Git, hard to set up, for reads only

* no auth: this is server dependent e.g. work servers prompt user/pw for public repos but Github/lab do not
```sh

gitignore https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository
* _user_: `~/.config/git/ignore`
* _repo_: `.gitignore`
* `/` interpolated as the root of your directory i.e. `/app/logs` will ignore anything in `/app/logs` but not, say, `/logs` (that is, a `logs` dir located in your root direct)
* this works recursively; [all subdirectories are affected as well](http://qr.ae/TU1tsk) i.e. any `logs` deeper inside `app/logs` will also be ignored
* `logs`, on the other hand, will ignore anything in *any* `logs` directory located *anywhere* in your project

notas post-mortem
* outcome: messed up looking git log
* cause: `commit --amend --no-edit` on feature branch (`sprint`) and then merged to main
* work around: forked repo, then realized I could just create new `main` in existing repo bc `sprint` and `master` had always been aligned (my workflow was squashing `sprint` at week's end and merging that to `master`). so, spent a week working in a new repo and moving those file changes to old repo, and then at week's end, once I confirmed the git log looked better, just replaced new repo w/ old repo.
