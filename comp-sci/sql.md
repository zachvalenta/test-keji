## keys

primary key (PK) 🗄 indexing `connolly.pdf`
* _candidate key_: key(s) that could serve as PK https://stackoverflow.com/a/12813385 📙 Winand 1.5
* _primary key_: attr w/ unique constraint that serves as ID of record
* _composite key_: n keys unique together used as PK
* slower than surrogate https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2786238
* https://github.com/aswinkarthik/csvdiff
* https://sirupsen.com/napkin/problem-5
* _compound key_: composite key + all keys also FK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key
* e.g. join table https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGDtnBCwgg
* sometimes used interchangeably w/ 'composite' https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/3137/201798 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfrcHdE_HI 1:40
```sql

```
* _natural key_: attr that goes together with other attr in table (vs. surrogate key)
* _surrogate key_: unrelated to table attr https://stackoverflow.com/a/36773462
* typically autogenerated but doesn't necessarily have to be 📙 Beaulieu 2.31
```sql

```
* _sequence_: Karwin chapter 4, Beaulieu 2.31 https://stackoverflow.com/a/1649128
* don't expose via API, use uuid https://0of1.com/blog/posts/django-staples/
* autoincrementing https://retool.com/blog/how-to-work-with-auto-increment-in-sql-query/ aka identity column https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-identity/
```sql

```

foreign key (FK)
* _foreign key_: constraint enforcing reference to another table's PK
```sql
foreign key (band) references bands (band_id)
```
* aka referential integrity aka prevent garbage in garbage out https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/tutorial-fk.html
* _parent_: table to which FK refers https://sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_basics
* _child_: table w/ FK 📙 Beaulieu 2.30-36, 5.82
* can be self-referencing? 📙 Beaulieu 5.93
* find FK referencing table ` SELECT * FROM information_schema.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS WHERE CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA='tableName' AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE='FOREIGN KEY'`

## migrations

🗄
* `system.md` deployment
* `lang/python/django/migrations-sandbox`

data migrations
* _data migration_: DML; change data itself
* _fixture_: data migration using serialization
* _factory_: data migration using ORM obj https://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy/

schema migrations
* _schema_: DDL; change schema (alongside related change in src) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration
* no needs to manually alter tables https://realpython.com/django-migrations-a-primer/#ensuring-model-definitions-and-the-database-schema-in-sync

schema migrations - scenarios
* https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2021/05/25/django-migrations-and-deployment
* _rollback_: https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/09/16/year-of-kubernetes/
> We learned in the process of moving from VMs to Kubernetes that it was extremely beneficial for us to have an easy way to move traffic between the old and new infrastructure, and to keep legacy infrastructure available for rollback in the first few days after the migration.
> And if what you care about is downtime, your first thought shouldn’t be "how do I reduce deployment downtime from 1 second to 1ms", it should be "how can I ensure database schema changes don’t prevent rollback if I screw something up." - https://pythonspeed.com/articles/dont-need-kubernetes/
> Applying a schema migration to a production database is always a risk...the migration process needs a high level of discipline, thorough testing and a sound backup strategy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Database https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration
* _rm attr_: instead of dropping can just hide from interface https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/47k7kl/how_do_i_make_a_migration_without_dropping_columns/
* _add attr_: nullable or add default for old records; if nullable, need to update API if you don't want to return those null values; defaults not recommended [Kleppmann 4.130]
> in Django, if you add default at model level, the old records are still null, yes? so you'd still have to update API to handle those, as you would if you'd made the attr nullable
> in Django, how do people handle the one-off default for existing data? before you have prod data, foo values seem fine, but curious to hear a discussion on this topic
```diff
class Foo(models.Model):
    bar = models.CharField(max_length=255)
+   baz = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True)
```
```sh
+----+---------+----------+
| id | bar     | baz      |
+----+--------------------+
| 1  | bar val | <null>   |
| 2  | bar val | baz val  |

compatibility https://thorben-janssen.com/update-database-schema-without-downtime/
* _backward compatibility_: new code can handle old data [Kleppmann 4.112]
> is the old data really old?
> e.g. add attr, previous records don't have value for attr but have attr itself
> client/server can just massage data to handle null values

* _forward compatibility_: old code can handle new data; typically harder to do [Kleppmann 4.112] typically old code doesn't touch new fields [ibid 4.129]
> how would this happen unless you logged in 

Flyway https://flywaydb.org/documentation/ https://github.com/zachvalenta/flyway-tutorial
* how it works
> It's semi automatic because it does not find out what has actually changed in your model. You need to write actual SQL scripts that have versions. It will create a separate table to keep track what version you have in your data base and that execute the script automatically up to the point where the latest version is reached.
* _alternatives_: Liquibase https://return.co.de/blog/articles/java-development-fast/ https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate
* _CLI_: db you're connected to, what migrations need to be run; selects subset of `flyway_schema_history`; can change name of `flyway_schema_history` in `flyway.conf > flway.table`
* _config_: `flyway.conf` unless overriden from CLI
* _directory structure_: `flyway` (CLI; bash script gathers input and then runs Flyway, itself a Java app) `lib` (actual Flyway application) `sql` (ur scripts here)
* _migration script location_: `classpath:db/migration` (in src) `libexec/sql` (in local Flyway install)
* _naming conventions_: whole numbers or timestamps, pad your numbers, don't alter in `flyway.conf`
* _types_: versioned (default) repeatable https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/repeatable undo https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/undo just make a new migration file (vs. using `flyway repair`) ['How to Correct a Mistake in a Migration']
* _versions_: looks at `version` table; version numbers https://flywaydb.org/documentation/migrations#naming
* _with Java_: if you drop tables and rerun app, run `mvn clean install` before rerun (think something cached between runs (in `target`?) indicating that scripts have already been run --> this is weird bc Flyway should look to version table in the database for that)

## normalization

🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms

forms
* _1NF_: 1 value for each attr
* aka atomic 📙 Takahashi [58] Winand [6]
```sql
-- pre-1NF: n values for each record
insert into danzi(item) values ('quesidilla, churro');

-- 1NF: 1 value for each record
insert into danzi(item) values ('quesidilla');
insert into danzi(item) values ('churro');
```

* _2NF_: non-PK must be related to PK 📙 Conery imposter 316 Takahashi 3.63 https://stackoverflow.com/a/724032
* symptom is redundancy (value repeats across records w/out reference to FK) and therefore anomaly (value could be mispelled) 📙 Karwin 289
```sql
-- TITLE dependent on COURSE_ID but unrelated to SEMESTER_ID
CourseID | SemesterID | #Places  | Title        |
------------------------------------------------|
IT101    |   2009-1   | 100      | Programming  |

IT103    |   2009-2   | 120      | Web Design   |

```

normalization
* _normalization_: process of extracting entities from other entities
* _form_: step in normalization

* saves space (no dupes) 📙 Kleppmann 2.33
* how to normalize: one big mess and decompose from there, think of example queries
* _5NF (Boyce-Codd)_: when you're going too far 📙 Winand 1.5

denormalization
* when speed more of a concern 📙 Conery imposter 320 Kleppmann 491
* aka unnormalized 📙 Manga 3.62
* _locality_: proximity of data relevant to an entity 📙 Kleppmann 2.32 🗄 `db.md` document

* importance
> Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because they have such a profound effect: not only on how the software is written, but also how we think about the problem that we are solving. 📙 Kleppmann [31]
> This is one reason it's so important to model your domain correctly: if, for example, you make something a property of A when it should be a property of B, the penalty is often that operations that formerly required checking all the As or all the Bs now require checking all the As and all the Bs. https://www.natemeyvis.com/writing/on-quadratic-complexity/

-- can't just use distinct bc works on records, not columns
-- i.e. result set valid bc each record different e.g. 5 rose st + house_id 1 != 5 rose st + house_id 3
select distinct house_id, addr from house

* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27760154
* https://alexpetralia.com/posts/2017/7/19/more-dangerous-subtleties-of-joins-in-sql

## basic

* _join_: include attr from n tables in result set 📙 Beaulieu 5.82
* for-loop combining records from diff tables based on condition
* _driving table_: starting point of join 📙 Beaulieu 5.90
```sql
-- no condition = cartesian result set (35)
from renter
join house
-- condition = non-cartesian (11)
from renter
join house
    on renter.district = house.district
```

* where / on / using
```sql
-- WHERE: old syntax
select * from employee, lob where employee.lob_id = lob.id

-- ON: new syntax (SQL92), portable across dbms 📙 Beaulieu 5.86-7
select * from employee, lob on employee.lob_id = lob.id

-- USING: use w/ equi join if tables have attr w/ same name 📙 Beaulieu 5.85 https://www.neilwithdata.com/join-using
select * from employee, lob using employee.lob_id = lob.lob_id
```

* 3 tables 📙 Beaulieu 5.88
```sql
-- basic
select deal.deal_id, house.addr, renter.`name`
from deal
    join house on deal.house = house.house_id
    join renter on deal.renter = renter.renter_id

-- w/ through table
select job_id, city
from job
    join job_geo on job.job_id = job_geo.job
    join geo on job_geo.geo = geo.geo_id
where job_id = 3
```

## I/O, L/R

* _inner_: result set doesn't include rows for which the join fails 📙 Beaulieu 5.83
* dbms defaults to inner 📙 Beaulieu 5.83-85
* most common type 📙 Evans 10
```sql
-- add to litecli.conf
select r.name, h.addr
from house as h
    join renter as r
    on r.district = h.district
```

* _outer_: result set does include rows for which join fails 📙 Beaulieu 5.84
```sql
-- pass
```

* _left_: left table determines count of result set 📙 Beaulieu 10.187
* right table provides match if found 📙 Evans 11-12
```sql
select r.name, d.deal_id
from renter as r
    join deal as d
    on r.renter_id = d.renter
+--------------+---------+
| name         | deal_id |
+--------------+---------+
| helen boss   | 1       |
| tom white    | 2       |
| sofia brown  | 3       |
| michael lane | 4       |
+--------------+---------+

select r.name, d.deal_id
from renter as r
    left join deal as d
    on r.renter_id = d.renter
+---------------+---------+
| name          | deal_id |
+---------------+---------+
| helen boss    | 1       |
| michael lane  | 4       |
| susan sanders | <null>  |
| tom white     | 2       |
| sofia brown   | 3       |
+---------------+---------+
```

* _right_: right table determines count of result set 📙 Beaulieu 10.187
```sql
select d.deal_id, r.renter
from renter as r
    right join deal as d
    on r.renter_id = d.renter
+---------------+---------+
| name          | deal_id |
+---------------+---------+
| helen boss    | 1       |
| michael lane  | 4       |
| susan sanders | <null>  |
| tom white     | 2       |
| sofia brown   | 3       |
+---------------+---------+
```

## self / equi

self, cross, natural, equi
* _self_: two instances of same table 📙 Beaulieu 5.93
```sql
-- pass
```

* _cross_: Cartesian product due to lack of `on` clause 📙 Beaulieu 5.83
```sql
select * from house join deal
```

* _natural_: don't specify `on` clause
* server figures out (which it will only do if there's matching attr name across tables) 📙 Beaulieu 10.198
* don't use!
```sql
-- pass
```

* _equi_: equality 📙 Beaulieu 5.94
```sql
-- pass
```

* _non-equi_: membership https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-non-equi-joins-examples/
```sql
-- trick for both of these is using a non-equi join to unmatch permutations 🗄 `math.md` set theory
SELECT r1.name, r1.district, r2.name, r2.district
FROM renter as r1
    JOIN renter r2 ON r1.district = r2.district
    AND r1.renter_id < r2.renter_id

-- find dupes
select h1.house_id, h1.addr as "first occurence", h2.house_id, h2.addr as "second occurence"
from house as h1
    join house as h2 on h1.addr = h2.addr
    and h1.house_id < h2.house_id

-- recommendations
select r.name, h.house_id, h.district, h.addr, h.bedrooms, h.price
from renter as r
join house as h
    on r.district = h.district
    and h.price between r.rent_min and r.rent_max
    and r.bedrooms <= h.bedrooms
where h.house_id not in (select house from deal)

1) did not know Doordash/Google listings worked this way, feels both somewhat misleading but also entirely within their right (to the victor goes the spoils of customer intermediation)
2) I have actually never ordered delivery

editing panache
*Was this a bit shady? Maybe, but fuck Doordash. Note: I did confirm with my friend that he was okay with me writing this, and we both agreed, fuck Doordash.*

tricky, tricky
*Grubhub for their own sites generates a phone number for each restaurant that goes to a centralized, Grubhub owned call center. If someone calls in and orders via this number, the restaurant gets charged a fee. Apparently, some enterprising BD folks came up with the idea that Yelp could put the Grubhub phone numbers in place of the real restaurant phone number on the Yelp listing. Customers who think they’re “helping” their local restaurants by calling in the order are still creating a fee for Grubhub.*

> The relational data model enables those things. None of them require the language to be SQL.
> LINQ, spark, flink, kafka streams, pandas, dataframes are all widely used examples of an expression-based language-embedded approach to relational queries.

za
* _object_: anything e.g. table, user, trigger https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/sql_elements007.htm https://github.com/jOOQ/sakila/blob/ee1a637656aec2d82183ab451c56a3845315e761/mysql-sakila-db/mysql-sakila-drop-objects.sql

## commands

semantics 🗄 `language.md` semantics
* _command_: keyword + identifier
* _keyword_: part of SQL lang spec; not case sensitive
* _identifier_: value (cell, attribute); case-sensitive
* quotes: single for value, double for attr https://stackoverflow.com/q/1992314
```sql
SELECT "from" FROM foo WHERE something = 'val';
```
* _query_: `SELECT` command 📙 Karwin 6
* _statement_: non-`SELECT` commands 📙 Karwin 6

command types
* _DCL_: control; user perms https://stackoverflow.com/a/44898661
* _DDL_: definition; table structure and inter-table relationships https://stackoverflow.com/a/2578207
* _DML_: manipulation; CRUD

keyword types https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/sql-keywords-appendix.html https://www.sqlstyle.guide/#reserved-keyword-reference
* _keyword_: reserved + non-reserved
* case-insensitive
* _reserved_: word that cannot use as identifier e.g. `create`
* _non-reserved_: word that you can use as identifier but should use backtickets for e.g. `assertion`, `name`
> As a general rule, if you get spurious parser errors for commands that contain any of the listed key words as an identifier you should try to quote the identifier to see if the problem goes away. - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/sql-keywords-appendix.html

## DCL

* _get current user_: `select current_user;` or `select user();`
* _create user_: `CREATE USER alice WITH PASSWORD '1234';` `CREATE USER '<name>'@'localhost';
* scope reads to currrent user https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23308945

* give user perms to db
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <dbName>.* to '<userName>'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION; 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

* test user privileges
```sql
mysql -u user_name

* compared to Django https://apirobot.me/posts/introduction-to-sqlalchemy-orm-for-django-developers
* sessions
> This is not at all how SQLAlchemy's ORM component works. In SQLAlchemy you have an object called the “session”. It basically encapsulates a transaction. However it does more. Each object is tracked by primary key in this session. As such each object only exists once by primary key. As such you can safely make a lot of queries and you never have things out of sync. When you commit the session it will send all changes at once to the database in correct order, if you rollback the session nothing happens instead. - http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/19/sqlachemy-and-you/

* _backref_: used for 1-M, adds virtual column to obj from parent table that enforces constraint on child table itself https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/models/?highlight=backref https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/backref.html#linking-relationships-with-backref
```python
# PARENT
class Concert(db.Model):
    concert_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.Text)
    performances = db.relationship("Performance", backref="concert")

# backref = no change to underlying table
+-----+------------+---------+---------+------------+----+
| cid | name       | type    | notnull | dflt_value | pk |
+-----+------------+---------+---------+------------+----+
| 0   | concert_id | INTEGER | 1       | <null>     | 1  |
| 1   | name       | TEXT    | 0       | <null>     | 0  |
+-----+------------+---------+---------+------------+----+

# rather, gets virtual column i.e. query run on obj creation to fetch all child obj that reference parent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYWiDiIUxQc 15:20

# CHILD
class Performance(db.Model):
    perf_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    concert_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("concert.concert_id"))

# FK = adds constraint via column on underlying table
+-----+------------+---------+---------+------------+----+
| cid | name       | type    | notnull | dflt_value | pk |
+-----+------------+---------+---------+------------+----+
| 0   | perf_id    | INTEGER | 1       | <null>     | 1  |
